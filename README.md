Interact with Smartsheets using ChatGPT.

To create a code that allows interaction between a chatbot and a user with Smartsheets, we need to consider that the user has a Pro Plan for Smartsheets but no API access. Since we cannot use the Smartsheets API directly, we will need to find an alternative way to interact with Smartsheets. One possible solution is to use the Smartsheets web interface and simulate user actions through a browser automation tool.

Here is a high-level plan for both scenarios:

Scenario 1: API Access Enabled
Authentication Class: Create a class to handle authentication with Smartsheets using the user's API key.

authenticate(): Method to authenticate with the Smartsheets API.
Chatbot Interface Class: Create a class to handle the interaction between the chatbot and the user.

receive_message(): Method to receive messages from the user.
send_message(): Method to send messages to the user.
process_command(): Method to process user commands and interact with Smartsheets.
Smartsheets Interaction Class: Create a class to handle direct interaction with Smartsheets.

get_sheet_data(): Method to retrieve data from a specific sheet.
update_sheet_data(): Method to update data in a specific sheet.
create_sheet(): Method to create a new sheet.
delete_sheet(): Method to delete a sheet.
Main Flow: Create the main flow of the application that initializes the chatbot, authenticates with Smartsheets, and starts listening for user input.

Error Handling: Implement error handling throughout the application to manage API errors, user input errors, and other exceptions.

Testing: Write unit tests for each class and method to ensure they work as expected.

Documentation: Document the code and provide instructions on how to set up and use the chatbot.

Scenario 2: No API Access
Browser Automation Setup: Choose a browser automation library and set it up to simulate user actions on the Smartsheets web interface.

Chatbot Interface Class: Similar to the API access scenario, create a class to handle the interaction between the chatbot and the user.

Smartsheets Web Interaction Class: Create a class to handle interaction with the Smartsheets web interface through browser automation.

login(): Method to log in to Smartsheets.
navigate_to_sheet(): Method to navigate to a specific sheet.
read_sheet_data(): Method to read data from a sheet.
write_sheet_data(): Method to write data to a sheet.
create_sheet_web(): Method to create a new sheet through the web interface.
delete_sheet_web(): Method to delete a sheet through the web interface.
Main Flow: Create the main flow of the application that initializes the chatbot and starts listening for user input.

Error Handling: Implement error handling to manage browser automation errors, user input errors, and other exceptions.

Testing: Write tests to ensure the browser automation works as expected.

Documentation: Document the code and provide instructions on how to set up and use the chatbot.

Before proceeding with the implementation, we need to confirm with the user whether API access can be enabled or if we should proceed with browser automation. Additionally, we need to choose the appropriate libraries for HTTP requests (if using API) or browser automation (if no API access), and for creating the chatbot interface.

Given that API access cannot be enabled on Smartsheets, we will proceed with the browser automation scenario. Here are the steps we will take to implement the solution:

1. Set up a browser automation library suitable for interacting with the Smartsheets web interface.
2. Create a class to handle the chatbot interface, which will include methods for receiving and sending messages, as well as processing user commands.
3. Create a class for Smartsheets web interaction that will handle login, navigation, reading, writing, creating, and deleting sheets through browser automation.
4. Implement the main flow of the application to initialize the chatbot and handle user interactions.
5. Add error handling to manage browser automation errors, user input errors, and other exceptions.
6. Write tests to ensure the browser automation and chatbot interaction work as expected.
7. Document the code and provide instructions on how to set up and use the chatbot.

Let's begin by setting up the browser automation library. We will choose a library that is compatible with the current environment and can simulate user actions on a web page. Once the library is set up, we will proceed with creating the necessary classes and methods for the chatbot and Smartsheets web interaction.
